# Kali Linux for Orange Pi
Kali Linux built for Orange Pi ARM64 devices.

I am creating this repository because it feels like support for my new Orange Pi 5 Plus is severely lacking compared to the Raspberry Pi.

I am building Kali Rolling Releases for each desktop environment as well as a CLI version using the official [Kali ARM build script](https://www.kali.org/docs/development/arm-build-scripts/).
